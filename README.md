## About

Sekiro API is a free API that provides information about the video game **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice**, such as weapons, items, characters, and more. The data is sourced from [Fextralife](https://sekiroshadowsdietwice.wiki.fextralife.com/Sekiro+Shadows+Die+Twice+Wiki) and [Wikidot](http://sekirothegame.wikidot.com/) and is returned by the API in JSON format.

## Documentation

Documentation generated using the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is available [here](http://sekiroapi.com/).

## Local Development

To run Sekiro API locally, follow these steps:

## Deployment

Sekiro API is automatically deployed to [Render](https://render.com/) when a push is made to the main repository branch. This project currently uses their free tier which spins down with inactivity. This means that the API suffers from a "cold start" delay, and the first request to the API after a period of inactivity may take up to one minute.
